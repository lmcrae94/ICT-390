      <p>
        Auto Union was a joined company made up of 4 German car manufacturers.
        Like Mercedes Auto Union was given a government grant to use to build their racing car.
        They decided to make their race car mid-engined. All other competing cars maintained the traditional front engined cars.
        The first Auto Union race car was the Auto Union Type A. The type B and Type C models were technical refinements of the Ariginal Type A car.
        Engine power also increased from the type A to the type C. The type C produced 520 bhp from a 6 litre V16 engine and competed from 1936-1937.
        For the 1938 and 1939 Seasons Auto Union designed their last race car the Type D.
        The Type D differed from the type C in the engine and the overall shape of the car.
        The car was powered by a smaller 3 litre V12 producing 420 bhp.
        This Type D was shorter in length with the driver compartment moved further back from the front of the car which allowed for better control.
        Today it is believed that only 5 Auto Unions are still in existence. The rest were lost to Allied Bombing raids and to Soviet engineers who researched the vehicles only to then scrap them.
